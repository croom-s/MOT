The first one was an outdoor back ground, the second was an office/school room.	It moved during the second round.	No. I didn't really care.	No.

I think I did a little above average.	I tried to focus on the four dots and it felt like tracking certain dots while trying to watch other dots with each individual eye almost  was occurring at times or it was an illusion that this was happening.	The one background was black and the other appeared to be viewing it on a laptop on a desk in a classroom.	I did not notice any differences in the backgrounds other then the two I listed before.	no	I did not experience any trouble.

I think I did well.	I didn't notice myself using any strategies, no.	The background image was a laptop sitting on a table and sometimes a laptop on a table and a box of some sort sitting underneath.	I noticed that sometimes there was a box on the floor and sometimes there wasn't.	No, I didn't	No, I didn't experience any difficulties.

I just tried to stare at the center and keep my focus on the 4 dots	A cubicle with light tan desk top. There was a 4 drawer cabinet to the left	I noticed that there were differences, but didn't pay close attention	Yes	No

I think I did fairly well as I know I got at least one or two in each sequence.	Not really. I just focused on the cross-area and let my eyes keep track in my field of vision.	I honestly didn't pay much attention to it...but I think one was black and one was a mini macbook laptop.	Only if you count the solid background vs the active screen being inside a mini laptop. A screen within a screen, if you will.	No. I didn't even notice that it shifted....	When I was redirected to the new background it told me that the experiment was not optimized for mobile devices and did not go away until I refreshed. Then it worked fine.

There was no strategy just performance.	I think the first one was a picture of a lake and the second one of an office.	Nothing in particular across each trial.	No.	I did not.

I think I probably did average some of them were more difficult than others.	No, I didn't notice myself using any special strategies.	The first one was just a solid color but I don't remember what color. The second one looked like it was in an office, there was a laptop, desk, and i think a plant.	No I didn't notice any different background images I was trying not to focuss on that.	No I didn't notice that at all.	No, everything ran fine.
