I would focus on 1-2 and use peripheral vision to track the others.	The first was an outdoor scene, next came a computer monitor sitting on a desk and other locations in an office.	I noticed the computer moving to different locations.	yes, once	you can drag your cursor over a dot in order to highlight it. It will stay high lighted as it moves around. I accidentally discovered this around trial 24 or so.	1536	762	6	12

I think I did quite well.	I noticed I did better if I just tried to focus on the middle of the image instead of on following any of the circles.	Most of them looked like classroom images like a chalkboard or a desk.	I think the first trial had a black background with nothing really in it. I did not notice the first trials background really.

I did not.	One was a scene of nature the other was a laptop that rotated between desks and tables.	I just saw the two main ones, with the 2nd one (36 trials) being a laptop on a desk or a table.

I think I did fairly well with my performance.	I tried to focus directly on the moving dots at first. Later, I allowed my eyes to blur out so I could watch the dots less directly.	The background image of the first round was a beautiful nature scene with trees. The second background was very boring with a laptop inside a building.	I noticed possibly through the laptop study that something changed in the background or so it seemed. More obviously, I noticed that they shifted from nature to a laptop scene.	I didn't notice this personally but I was focused on the dots. In retrospect, it is very possible.	Everything went smoothly for me.	1918	1009	8	14

The next ones were classrooms.	The classrooms changed a little bit, but I was focused on the dots and can't tell you what specifically changed.	I did not notice that.	None	1920	938	6	9

I tried to just look at the monitor and not focus my eyes on one dot.	One was a laptop computer and the other I can't remember very well (I think it looked like an old Windows desktop (blue).	I noticed the background changed once but other than that nothing.	I didn't notice it but now that you mention it I remember that.	No issues.	1920	978	6	10

I feel like I did better than I expected.	I tried to force myself to concentrate on the four designated spots, but not focus on any one in particular. I tried to focus on the whole field in order to better follow all the spots but only pay attention to the ones that flashed at the beginning.	The first background image was a mountain scene. The second background image a desk with a computer on it.	The background seemed irrelevant so I did not focus on it very much.	No.	I initially tried to access this in IE and it did not work, so I had to reopen it in Chrome.	1680	918	7	16

I felt I was doing good if I got three or more each time.	I tried to look in the middle of the screen and let each eye follow two balls	One was a mountain scene and it had water with it.  The second scene was a computer sitting in a room with shredded paper box on the floor.	Yes in the second one with the computers - I noticed different colors or background scene changes.	No I didn't.  I kept focusing on the computer.	No problems.  Thank you.	1920	938	8	13

I think I did alright, compared to average.	I just tried to look at the whole screen and did not focus on any individual elements of the scene.	The first one was very plain, the second one seemed to emulate a kid's room and the study was displayed on a picture of a Macbook	I did not notice any differences in any of the trials, except for the transition from the plain background to the simulated Macbook.	No, maybe there was some of that in some of them but since it was simulated it didn't bother me enough to allow the instability to register on a conscious level.	No, everything seemed to run exactly as it was supposed to run.	1536	750	15	22

It aimed to see if someone can track objects not in their direct line of sight.	There were a few mistakes, but I feel I did pretty well.	I tried to view all objects at the same time by zoning out in the middle of the pattern. I tried not to follow one specific dot the whole time.	The first background image was a nature setting. The second was a laptop in an office setting.	The only difference I noticed was the nature vs. office change that occurred.	No, I did not notice that.	No trouble was encountered.	1366	657	5	11

I did pretty well and got all 4 in most of the rounds.	I let my vision go kind of out of focus and tracked the general movement of all 4 at once instead of trying to switch my focus around between them.	They looked like various office spaces.	I noticed they looked different but was too busy focusing on the task at hand to pay much mind to the details.	no	no	1280	664	7	12
