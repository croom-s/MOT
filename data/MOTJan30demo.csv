I think I did about as well as anyone else.	I just tried to keep my focus on the 4 balls at all times.	The first was a picture of a lake or something.

Maybe even brain processing because you have to keep track of all the dots.	I did average. It got harder as time went on. The dots moved quicker and further apart.	No, I just tried to keep track of them with my eyes. If one got lost, I would stick with the majority of dots closest together.	I think one was a picture of an outside scene and another was a picture of a computer.	I did not notice any differences. I was too focused on keeping up with the dots. That was my main objective.	Yes, I did notice that but only on the photo with the laptop.	I did not experience any problems.	1366	657	7	15

I guess the experiment was testing how easily or difficult it is to follow moving objects and identify the same objects after the movement has stopped?	I think I did pretty decent.	I usually just trained my eyes on the four balls and followed them as best as possible. Sometimes If they separated into two groups (two in each group), I as able to follow them much easier.	From what I remember the background images were of classrooms. I believe there were books, a globe and a chalkboard.	Some images contained different items but were the same setting, a classroom I believe. I don't remember much more.	No I did not notice that.	N/A	2048	1016	6	13

I think I did pretty well but definitely not perfect.	When the dots started moving I would kind of &quot;unfocus&quot; my eyes and look pretty much at the center of the black background. That way I could track the four dots (not perfectly) in my peripheral vision a little.	They were MacBook Air's on tables, and sometimes they were over the edge of the table by a decent amount.	On at least one of the backgrounds the MacBook was in the center of the table instead of the edge.	Yes, after maybe half of the rounds I started to notice this.

I did ok with 3 dots.	Background at first was like a landscape or something..peaceful..but the last of them where it was like a computer monitor with  a lot of bright color that contrasted some was very hard.	Yes, the perspective seemed to change..and it seemed like they got &quot;busier&quot; as it went on.	No.. i was too focused on the balls and tracking.. I tried to ignore the background and focus on the task.	No.. I just had trouble tracking the dots but that is part of the task I think.

I think I did much better than average.	I found you had to follow the many, letting the stray go. But, you could follow the 3 with your eyes, and follow the 4th stray with your head and peripheral.

I think I did pretty well, but I'm not fully sure.	Not really special, but I did try to focus on the + in the center and let my peripheral vision sort of keep track of the balls. The hardest was when they moved fast after colliding.	Mostly the background images were of work spaces and desks. One of them had the computer sitting at the very very edge nearly falling off.	One of them had the computer almost falling off the edge, and I found that very distracting. The images that weren't of the outdoor scenery were harder.	Yes!
