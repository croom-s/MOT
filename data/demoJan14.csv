Or maybe testing how much we can follow moving objects.	I did okay, even if sometimes my eyes give me issues with severe eye syndrome and floaters in one eye (the right one.	Not really.	The background images were not distracting to me. The second one, which was a desk area was slightly more memorable.	Yes they changed.

I think I did okay, but the second part was harder than the first.	Just trying to keep focus on the four targets without narrowing my attention down to one of them, so as to keep my field of vision as wide as possible.	It looked kind of like a store background and I don't recall the first image. I was trying to focus and not be distracted by the background images.	The first and second set of trials had different background imagery. I don't recall the first background image. It wasn't very attention grabbing, regardless and I think it was rather plain. The second one was much busier.	No.	No, everything was fine.	1920	938	7	16
