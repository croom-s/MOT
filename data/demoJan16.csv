Sometimes I lost track of things, but if you had asked what the changes were in the background I would not have known.	Tried to segregate the dots I wanted.	An office area with a desk and computer as well as some food dishes off to the side.	Some were dark, some light. Some had things disappear (whatever was under the desk.	No, I didn't notice that.

When the background changed to one that was less common it drew my eye away initially from the task more than one that was regularly displayed and I felt I did worse on the tracking.	I think I did average.	I would not focus my eyes on anything in particular. I found it was most accurate for me to just stare into an area near the dots and my peripheral vision did the work. Blinking or allowing my eye to be caught by anything would cause me to lose track.	The images were of a forest with a black work area and then various office settings with the work area being depicted as a macbook air.	The background would change from being lighters image of the floor and desks to being heavier, darker images of a forward view of a chalkboard and walls.	No, I didn't even think of the work area as being a physical object affected by gravity. It was just a superimposed, perfectly centered screen to me. Maybe if the work area changed positions with the background instead of also being stationary.	I did not.	1280	721	7	22

I think that I did a little bit better than the average person since I was able to follow the targets the majority of the time.	I just tried to follow the targets throughout the screen.

I missed a couple of the dots but got most of them.	I just sat back and followed the dots.	One was a classroom setting and the other was a landscape.	There were 2 different background images.	No	I did not have any issues	1920	938	9	13

I think I did about average. I was kind of surprised I was getting as many as I did.	Focus on flashing dots and then unfocus when they start moving and just watch the whole picture and watch all the dots at once. I sort of envision trails behind the flashing dots to track them.	Different office or school environments.	I noticed it seemed I was getting more right when there was the image with the trash can. Weird.	Oh yeah! I did notice that. It was a little unnerving actually.	No trouble. I found it very enjoyable. Sort of like a puzzle game.	1920	938	9	22

I think I did reasonably well.	No, I didn't have any specific strategy.	The first was a nature background (trees and flowers), the second was a laptop in an office setting.	The first took place outdoor while the 2nd took place indoor.	No.	No.	1667	951	6	21

I didn't take any special strategies. I just focused on the cross and followed the circles.	The first set with the faces had a calming landscape picture. The second picture was of a laptop and desk in a room.	I only notice two different background changes. The first background was a landscape and the second was of a laptop and room setting.	I didn't notice it originally but the laptop is hardly on the table.	I had no trouble. Have a wonderful day!	1366	657	10	19

I tried to not concentrate on any one dot, but rather the center and just get an impression of where the four dots were.  If I started concentrating on just one or two dots, I lost the others.	There was a computer monitor, and a nature scene.	The background images were very different, and I preferred the desktop scene with the computer monitor.	No, I did not	No trouble	1280	720	8	24
