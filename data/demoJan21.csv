Men and women have different abilities in multitasking so this is seeing which is better.	I think overall I did quite well.	No I just followed all dots at all times.	A computer desk I believe was the main background. The other background may have been a paint can but I didn't pay attention to them while focusing on the dots.	No not really as I just focused on the dots.	No I didnt.	No I didn't	1366	657	7	14

Testing memory for final movements of selected objects.	I think I did fair, I would imagine I got somewhere around 50-60 percent correct.	I could not remember the locations of all 4 of the objects so I just tried to focus on 1 object at a time. I then tried to focus on 2 objects hoping I would get at least 50% correct.	The 1st background image I believe was a landscape. The second background was the laptop screen of a &quot;Mac-Air&quot; laptop.	Not really paying that much attention to the background images for changes.	I did NOT notice this at all. I was actually focusing on the brand of laptop.

I think I did fairly well.	Not really. Just paying attention.	The background images mostly appeared to be offices.

Positioning of the laptop may have also acted as a distraction.	I did fairly well in the initial rounds, but my performance suffered greatly during the second part of the study.	I tried to follow groups of circles as closely as possible.	One background appeared to be of a forest and lake while the second background appeared to be of a classroom or lab.	One was a natural environment and the second one was man-made.	Yes	No issues	1920	969	7	14

I tried to see the dots I was supposed to pay attention to as one object and not get distracted by the movement of individual dots.	They were work space scenes.

Considering the background image changes, probably something else to do with if that impacted that ability.	If you'd asked me before hand, I'd say that I'd do terribly at such a task, but based on how well I did when there was feedback, I think I actually did ok in general.	When the circles flashed, if there was a group near each other, I think I tried to treat them as such -- at least until they got away from each other.	There was a landscape scene with a lake and there was a laptop (such that the working area was that laptop's screen) in a classroom, I guess -- blackboard, printer in the background. Those are the only two I really paid attention to.	I already described all that I noticed of any of the images.	Nope.	No problems.	1366	768	6	16

Perhaps different people saw different things.	I think I did better than the average person.	I just tried not to focus on only one of the balls but tried to see all 4 at the same time. It wasn't easy!	The background images were an office setting, on a laptop screen.	Yes. The first trial had an outdoor background. The second trial had an office background.

No special strategies except to just try to open up my vision and not concentrate on one particular area.	It was located in an office space with a kitchen and coffee set up off to the side.
