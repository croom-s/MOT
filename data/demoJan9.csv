I tried to use my peripheral vision to keep all of the dots in my eye line.	The background looked like a desk area of a library. Possibly at a school. It had a few desks but I didnt pay attention to it much.	I didnt.	no, I paid attention to the screen.	Everything worked as intended.

I just tried to keep the balls in my periphery.	The background images were of a desk with random items on it.	No.	No.	No.

The background images were of a laptop on a desk in a classroom.	The background changed a few times but I don't remember what the differences were.	yes	No

It was a little nerve racking towards the end.	I thought it was easier to sit a little further back from the screen as opposed to being closer.	The background looked like an office.	Some of them looked and a school office while the other one looked like a classroom.	Yes. It looks as though they were photo shopped in	I did not!
216.57.251.166	09/January/2019	06:23:27	06:36:01	S29937028	3.37	0.61	0.56	11	10	24	F	20 inches and 1920 x 1080 pixels	How distractions influence our ability to focus on main tasks.	I think I got about 75% of the trials right.	No, I just tried following the dots as best as I could.	One of the images was scenery and the other image was of a computer sitting on a table.	No	No	No

I watched the dots that blinked.	The first one was a forest scene. The second was various office settings.	Some of the office setting changed.	no	I had no trouble.

I was just trying to concentrate.	The first background image was nice and natural, the other ones were of an office.	I noticed different office pictures being used.	No I did not notice that.	I did not experience any trouble.

But I felt the difficulty had much more to do with the specific movement/pattern in each instance and no relation to the background, so I don't know.	Pretty well, although there was one example where the tracking cross in the center was covered by a ball which completely threw me off and I ended up guessing at random.	No, just tracking the objects.	A desk, a classroom, possibly and office space.	They changed but nothing significant.  At one point it became something on a laptop, but that's about it.	Unstable?  No.	No
24.121.249.159	09/January/2019	06:20:54	06:39:29	S63710622	3.01	0.89	0.89	16	16	58	M	15 inch monitor, 1350x768	Ability to track multiple targets with distractors.	I think I did pretty well.  I just relaxed and took a field view of the dots and then I could eliminate the distractors and focus on the targets.	I just mentioned this in the previous question.  Trick is to relax, take in the field and put your intention to track on the targets.	The first was black.  The second was a laptop on a desk in a laboratory setting.	I did not.  I was not distracted by the background. I stayed focused only on the targets.	No, that was of no interest to me since there was no indication whatsoever that the background was of significance to my task.	There was a delay in loading the background several times that caused the dots to stutter and may have resulted in errors of my tracking those dots.

134.174.110.22	09/January/2019	06:57:20	07:06:36	S82535079	3.86	0.72	0.78	13	14	31	M	23, 1920 x 1080	How well we track things with different backgrounds.	I think I did okay, sometimes I lost focus for a split second and lost the dots.	I feel like I tried to make their motions seem realistic. Like the balls bounced off each other and I could track their movements that way.	First one was a landscape type things with trees and water. The second was a classroom with a blackboard and a computer.	In the 2nd trial the background seemed to change slightly, though it was in the same room it seemed.	No, I did not notice that.	None
24.225.117.43	09/January/2019	07:21:44	07:30:56	S88863859	1.57	0.67	0.61	12	11	5	8	24&quot; 1080p	Ability to track objects depending on distance from each other.	I think I did respectably.	If a group clustered alone in an area, I mostly ignored them and focused on those near others.	I saw offices I think?	I did a bit, but I didn't really pay attention to them so know exactly what was different. I was focused on the task.	No.	No.
73.177.103.254	09/January/2019	06:17:35	06:30:24	S97747093	2.12	0.56	0.22	10	4	29	F	32 inches, 1366 x 768	I really have no idea. I guess it was a visual memory test.	Probably not very well.	I just tried to focus on the center and take in the entire scene instead of following the circles.	I'm not sure what this is asking. Do you mean the laptop image? It's the only one I noticed.	I didn't notice any difference.	No I didn't notice any of the background images now that I see this. I only focused on the laptop screen.	I had no problems.
