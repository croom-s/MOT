Studies suggest that people allocate attention to, and preferentially recall, object configurations that are physically unstable. So, perceiving  physical scenes must include short-term predictions of how the events in the scene will unfold in the near future. In this work we propose a new experimental paradigm based on a Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task, designed to detect the effects of automatic inferences of physical scene dynamics on focused attention. Our initial experiments show that performance on a centrally presented MOT task declines when a physically unstable background, irrelevant to the task, is presented at the periphery. The effect persists despite participants actively trying to focus, and despite most participants report noticing no differences between the various stable and unstable backgrounds. 
This work is the first to conclusively show that physically unstable scenes attract attention independently of encoding the scene into scene memory.
